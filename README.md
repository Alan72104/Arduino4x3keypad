# Arduino4x3keypad

- swappable Arduino nano
- ws2812b addressable per-key RGB lighting
- hot-swappable switches

- due to external swappable arduino board, the total height will be kinda big, can be directly soldered on though, the 5v pin need to be manually soldered on using jumper wires

- because of the usage of arduino nano (can't be connected as a USB HID hardware), an external software is required to receive the keypad messages and tell the computer keypresses, the driver and GUI written in Autoit is on github (https://github.com/Alan72104/KeypadDriver)

acrylic case schematic is also available (https://oshwlab.com/alan72104/4x3-keypad)
